<p>"A delightful little play, 'Dr. Hardhack's Prescription,' was given by the
Junior Endeavor Society at Lyceum Hall, Worthington, Tuesday afternoon
and evening. The audience was composed largely of children at the matinee,
who were highly entertained, but no more so than the grown-ups in the
evening. Dr. Hardhack was played by a lad of ten, who did an excellent
piece of work. The other parts were all finely acted by children not much
older. The play was directed by the author and made an entertainment
long to be remembered and one too that netted a nice little sum for the Juniors'
work."&mdash;<i>Hampshire Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"One of the most charming little plays for children I ever have
seen."&mdash;<i>Mrs. G. J. Thomas, Chattanooga, Tenn.</i></p>

<p>"We used 'Dr. Hardhack's Prescription' for the Nature Study number in
our annual program. It was given by the youngest pupils and was a delight
to our audience. The play is complete in itself and perfectly charming, nevertheless
I ventured to add an epilog. Knowing the story of 'Little Pussy
Willow,' I adapted the gifts of the fairies ending with: 'Good night, dearie.'
We wish to thank the author for all her helpful suggestions and for such a
sweet play."&mdash;<i>Caroline Reed Thompson, Head of Department of Expression,
Arizona School of Music, Phenix, Ariz.</i></p>

<p>"A dear little play and we greatly enjoyed working it up. Our audience
was very enthusiastic and we are being urged to repeat."&mdash;<i>Miss A. H. Young, Wilton, N. H.</i></p>

<p>"We gave 'Dr. Hardhack's Prescription' as a Thanksgiving entertainment
by our younger pupils, and everyone was charmed with it."&mdash;<i>Emma Willard School, Troy, N. Y.</i></p>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Dr. Hardhack</span> makes a professional visit to the </i>Proudie<i> mansion,
New York City. In the sitting-room are gathered <span class="smcap">Grandma
Proudie</span> (L), <span class="smcap">Mamma Proudie</span> (C), <span class="smcap">Aunt Flighty</span> (R).</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma Proudie.</span> I greatly fear our dear Emily will never be
restored to health.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Flighty.</span> Oh, don't say that. I've known people to
look terribly white and a great deal thinner than Emily, and not
die of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandma Proudie.</span> [<i>To <span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span></i>] I thought you were
going to send for Dr. Hardhack.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> I have sent for him. [<i>Sighs, rises and comes forward,
taking chair</i>] [<i>R</i>] But what can he do? Someway it
doesn't seem as if he could help. He's such a small man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">GRANDMA P.</span> Size doesn't matter if one has brains. It's
brains that count, my dear. Napoleon was small, but he will
live forever. And look at Alexander Pope. [<i>Waves hand</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> [<i>Runs to window</i>] What! Where is he? Whom
did you say to look at?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandma P.</span> [<i>Witheringly</i>] Alexander Pope, who has been
dead one hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> [<i>Simpering</i>] Oh, I thought you said to look at
somebody going by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandma P.</span> I said "Look at Alexander Pope," by which I
meant "Consider Alexander Pope"&mdash;a small man, not ever
growing to be much larger than a child. But what a poet!
Brains, my dear, brains. In my day it was brains that decided a
person's value. Sometimes I think they have gone out of fashion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> But they will come in again, mother. All the old
fashions come round in about so many years, they say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Grandma P.</span> [<i>Who has returned to her knitting</i>] Perhaps
the time has come then for brains, for every one speaks so highly
of Dr. Hardhack.</p>

<p><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Maid</span></i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> Dr. Hardhack, madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> You may bring him in, Mary. [<i>Maid turns to go,
but finds <span class="smcap">Dr. Hardhack</span> at her heels</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma</span> and <span class="smcap">Grandma P.</span> [<i>Gasp</i>] Oh, Dr. Hardhack!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> Oh, oh! We did not know you really had come!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Hardhack.</span> Good morning, ladies. Couldn't stop to be
formally announced. [<i>Puts his hat absently in <span class="smcap">Aunt F</span>'s sewing-basket.
Basket falls and all the things go tumbling out. <span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span>
does not notice</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> [<i>Simpers</i>] Oh, oh!
[<i><span class="smcap">Maid</span> comes forward and assists
<span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> in picking up things</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> [<i>Looks about circle</i>] Which is my patient, please?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> It is my daughter Emily. I will send for her.
[<i>To <span class="smcap">Maid</span></i>] Mary, will you ask Miss Emily to come? [<i>Exit
<span class="smcap">Maid</span></i>] Oh, Dr. Hardhack, before she comes I must say a word
to you. [<i><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> takes chair</i>] We would be willing to found a
water-cure, to hire a doctor on purpose, to try homeopathy or
hydropathy or allopathy or any other pathy that ever was heard
of if our dear elegant Emily could only be restored. It is her
sensitive nature that wears upon her. She was never made for
this world. She has an exquisiteness of perception that makes
her feel even the creases in a rose leaf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Stuff and folderol, my dear madam! [<i><span class="smcap">All</span> start.
<span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> gasps and simpers</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> You are the nineteenth physician that has been
called in to dear Emily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Well, I hope that I may cut out number twenty!
[<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Emily</span> very pale and listless</i>] Oh, here comes the young
lady herself. [<i>Bows to <span class="smcap">Emily</span>, which greeting <span class="smcap">E.</span> very languidly
returns</i>] Humph! Let me look at her. [<i>Puts up his glasses
and looks through them</i>] [<i><span class="smcap">E.</span> stands supporting herself by table
as though very weak</i>] Humph! A fashionable potato sprout!
Grown in a cellar! Not a drop of red blood in her veins!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Grandma P.</span> [<i>Aside to <span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span></i>]
What odd ways he has,
to be sure. But then they say that's the way he talks to everybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> My dear madam, you have tried to make a girl out
of sugar and almond paste, and now you are distressed that she
has not red blood in her veins and that her lungs gasp and flutter
as she goes up-stairs. Turn her out to grass, my dear madam,
turn her out to grass!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> [<i>With hands over ears</i>] Oh, oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Yes, I mean what I say. Send her to old Mother
Nature to nurse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> [<i>Exultantly</i>] I have said all along, Doctor, that I
thought we ought to have a trained nurse for Emily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Trained fiddlesticks! [<i><span class="smcap">All</span> start</i>]
Send her somewhere
to a good honest farmhouse in the hills, and let her run
barefoot in the morning dew, drink new milk from the cow&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> [<i>Interrupts</i>] Oh, Doctor, not new milk! Not
unsterilized milk! [<i><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> holds up hands in horror</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> I mean what I say, madam. Let her drink new
milk from the cow, romp in a good wide barn, learn to hunt
hens' eggs, a few things like this, and I warrant me you'll see
another pair of cheeks in a year. Take off all whalebones and
strings around her lungs. Give her a chance, madam, give her
a chance!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> But what medicine shall she take, Doctor?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> [<i>Roars his disapproval</i>] Medicine? No medicine.
Medicine won't do her any good. You may make an apothecary's
shop of her stomach&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> Oh, oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> [<i>Turns toward <span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span></i>]
Yes, <i>stomach</i>,&mdash;make an
apothecary's shop of her stomach, and matters will be only the
worse. Why, there isn't enough iron in her blood to make a
needle. [<i>Points to needle in <span class="smcap">Aunt F's</span> hand</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> [<i>Simpers</i>] Oh, oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> Iron in her blood! I never heard the like!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Yes, iron, red particles, globules or whatever you
please to call them. Her blood is all water and lymph, and that
is the reason that her cheeks and lips look so like a cambric
handkerchief, why she pants and puffs if she goes up-stairs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
[<i>Motions to <span class="smcap">E.</span> to come forward, puts head to examine heart</i>]
Her heart is all right if there were only blood to work it in, but
it sucks and wheezes like a dry pump for want of vital fluid.
[<i>Emphatically</i>] She must have more blood, madam, and Nature
must make it for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandma P.</span> We were thinking of going to Newport, Doctor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> [<i>Derisively</i>] Yes, to Newport! To a ball every
night and a flurry of dressing and flirtation every morning!
No such thing! Send her to an unfashionable old farmhouse
where there was never a more exciting party than a quilting
frolic heard of. Let her learn the difference between huckleberries
and blackberries, learn where checkerberries grow thickest
and dig up sweet flag root with her own hands as country
children do. It would do her good to plant a few hills of
potatoes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> <i>Our</i> Emily! Potatoes! Oh, dreadful, dreadful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Yes, potatoes. Plant a few hills of potatoes and hoe
them herself as I once heard of a royal princess doing, because
[<i>With emphasis</i>] <i>queens</i> can afford to be sensible in the bringing
up of <i>their</i> daughters!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> What you say is all very new, Dr. Hardhack.
Indeed, we had never thought of such a thing as sending Emily
into the <i>real</i> country. But I will talk it over with Mr. Proudie,
and see what he thinks of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Well, ladies, I must be going. Good-morning to you
all. [<i>Takes up hat and medicine case and makes exit in haste</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> What strange ways he has!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> But then you know he's all the fashion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> People talk of his being small. I never once
thought of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandma P.</span> Brains, my dear, brains, or in other words;&mdash;good
common sense.</p>

<p class="center">CURTAIN.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>
<h2>ACT II.</h2>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Dr. Hardhack</span> ready to give his last directions. <span class="smcap">Mamma
Proudie</span>, <span class="smcap">Aunt Flighty</span>, <span class="smcap">Aunt Highty-Tighty</span>, <span class="smcap">Emily</span> and
<span class="smcap">Dr. Hardhack</span> are all seated; <span class="smcap">E.</span> reclining languidly in easy
chair.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> Well, Doctor, we have decided to let Emily go
and stay in the country as you have directed. I have arranged
everything and found a pleasant place for her with a companion
of her own age who is called Pussy Willow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> H'm. Pussy Willow. Well, that begins to sound
right. Wouldn't have found any girl named Pussy Willow at
Newport, I'll warrant you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Highty-Tighty.</span> Do, pray, dear Dr. Hardhack, tell us
just how she must be dressed for that cold mountain region.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> It makes me shiver to think of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt H.-T.</span> Must she have high-necked, long-sleeved flannels?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> I will go right down and buy her half-a-dozen at
once. [<i>Starts to go, but is waved back by <span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span>, and resumes
seat</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Not so fast. Let's see about this young lady. [<i>Endeavors
to introduce his forefinger under the belt of <span class="smcap">E's</span> dress.
Belt snaps. <span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> draws out his finger with a jerk</i>] I thought
so. I supposed that there wasn't much breathing allowed behind
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> Oh, I do assure you, Doctor, Emily never dresses
tightly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emily.</span> No, indeed! I despise tight lacing. I never wear my
clothes any more than just comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Never saw a woman that did! The courage and constancy
of the female sex in bearing inconveniences is so great,
however, that that will be no test at all. Give me that thing.
[<i>Motions for <span class="smcap">E.'s</span> belt</i>] [<i><span class="smcap">E.</span> hands him same</i>] You wouldn't
catch a man saying he felt comfortable under such circumstances.
[<i>Holds up the tiny circle</i>] But only persuade a girl
that she looks stylish and pretty with her waist drawn in, and
you may lace her up till the very life leaves her, and with her
dying breath she will tell you she is nothing more than "comfortable".
So, my young lady, you don't catch me in that way!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
You must leave off belts and tight waists of all sorts for six
months at least, and wear only loose sacques so that your lungs
may have some chance to play and fill with the vital air that I
am going to send you to breathe up in the hills.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> But, Doctor, I don't believe I could hold myself up. [<i>Droops
as without any strength</i>] When I sit up in a loose dress I feel so
weak I hardly know what to do. I need the support of something
stiff around me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> That is because all those nice, strong muscles around
your waist [<i>Slapping his sides and holding himself very erect
with his hands on his ribs</i>] which Nature gave you to hold you
up, have been bound down and bandaged and flattened [<i>Emphasizes
the words by each time striking his right fist in palm of left
hand</i>] until they have no strength in them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> Do you suppose, Doctor, if I should dress as you tell me
for six months, that I would get my health again?</p>

<span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Never fear, my dear madam. It's only that there is

tell her to do it more yet!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> Yes, just hear what she has written, Doctor.
[<i>Finds letter and reads</i>] "You have no idea how different life
looks to me now that I live a little for somebody besides myself.
Why have I been so foolish as to suppose I was happy in living
such a lazy, useless life as I have lived?" [<i>Looks at <span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> as

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Iron in her blood, my dear madam, iron in her

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> Oh, shocking!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> [<i>Turns to <span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span></i>] Yes, <i>bouncing</i>! Why shouldn't
she bounce? I shall give you back a live niece in the fall instead
of a half dead one, and you [<i>Turns to <span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span></i>] a live daughter,
madam, and I expect you will all scream and stop your ears
and run under beds because you never saw a live girl before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> But, Doctor, I can't see as we shall ever get her
home again. I keep writing and writing, and still she says she
isn't ready. There is always something ahead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Let her alone, madam, let her alone. Give Nature a
good chance. You will all undo all the good she's getting as

<h2>ACT IV.</h2>

<p><i>Six months later than when <span class="smcap">Emily</span> went away. She has returned
home, bringing her friend, <span class="smcap">Pussy Willow</span>. In the room are
gathered <span class="smcap">Grandma P.</span>, <span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span>, the two aunts, also <span class="smcap">Emily</span>
and <span class="smcap">Pussy</span> and <span class="smcap">Dr. Hardhack</span>.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> Well, now, Dr. Hardhack, doesn't our Emily look
beautiful?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> So healthy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt H.-T.</span> Such a splendid color!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Pretty fair, pretty fair. A good summer's work, that.
[<i>Looks at <span class="smcap">E.</span> much pleased</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> And now, Doctor, we want you to tell us just what
she may do, just how much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt H.-T.</span> Of course you know now she's got into a city,
she can't dress exactly as she did up in the country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> I see, I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> There isn't a thing of all her clothes she can wear.
Having been all summer in those loose sacques, she's sort o'
<i>spread out</i>. [<i>Motions with her hands</i>]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Well, my advice is that you begin gradually screwing
her up. Get something with plenty of whalebones ready and a
good tough lacer. But don't begin too hard, just tighten a little
every day, and by and by she will get back to where her
clothes will fit her exactly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> [<i>Clapping her hands</i>] That's just what I said we
would have to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> But, Doctor, won't that injure her health?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Of course it will, but I fancy she will stand it for one
winter. It won't quite kill her, and that is all we doctors want.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emily.</span> [<i>Comes forward</i>] Well, I have something to say on
this point. I wouldn't lose my health again for anything that
can be named.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Oh, pooh, pooh! [<i>Waves his hand incredulously at
<span class="smcap">E.</span></i>] When patients are first up from a sickness, how prudent
they mean to be!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt H.-T.</span> But seriously, Doctor, you must tell us how
much it will be well to have Emily do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> One doesn't want to give up the world entirely, and
yet one doesn't want to lose one's health.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> I appreciate the case fully. [<i>Walks up and down
considering</i>] Let her begin with the opera twice a week and one
dance kept up till daylight. In a week she will feel stronger
than ever she did and declare nothing hurts her, then she can
take two dances, then three, and so on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Emily.</span> But, Doctor, I'm not going to dances at all. I know
now what life is, and what health is worth, and I'm not going
to waste it in that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Oh, it's all very well to talk! I knew a rich girl once
right in this city of New York who <i>would</i> go round visiting the
poor and sitting up with sick people, and there was no end to the
remarks made about her. No, you mustn't breathe bad air, nor
over-exert yourself unless you do so from a purely selfish motive.
Then, it's all right and proper. [<i>To <span class="smcap">Pussy</span></i>] Oh, you needn't
sit over there, looking mischievous, miss! What do you know
of life? You will soon learn to be ashamed of your rosy cheeks,
and think it's pretty to have bad health. I'll bet a copper
[<i>Slaps his knee</i>] that by spring, if we manage right, we can
send you back as white and withered as Miss Emily was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> Now, Dr. Hardhack, you dreadful man! You must stop
this talk. I brought Pussy down here on purpose to help me
live better than I have lived. It's so interesting now in New
York that Pussy is here with me. I never knew what wonderful
things there were here. Pussy taught me to know the birds this
summer at her home, and now we have been this morning to see
a most wonderful collection at the museum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mamma P.</span> [<i>Anxiously</i>] Is it wise, Doctor, for them to go
and look at those stuffed birds? To be sure the birds are under
glass, but I'm so afraid they will breathe poison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Not nearly as much as they would breathe if they
went to a crowded theatre, madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> It makes me shudder to think of all the hours I've spent
at the theatre. As I think of it now, the rooms were so hot and
overcrowded I wonder I ever lived through it. Since I've been
away, I have learned to love everything that is connected with
out-door life. Pussy has taught me. So now we have arranged
that Pussy shall spend the winter with me. She is to take
sing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>ing
and music lessons and have all the advantages of the city,
and I shall go to her for the summer. Of course, we shall take a
peep or two at New York sights, but we are not going into the
gay world, Doctor, really, we're not!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span> Ta, ta, ta! Don't tell me. [<i>Shakes finger warningly</i>]
I shall hear of you yet. You'll see!</p>

<p><i>Exit <span class="smcap">Dr. H.</span></i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pussy.</span> What a droll man he is! But I think he's just as nice
as he can be. I hope he will come again while I'm here. I like
to hear him talk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> It's his way to always run on in this strange style
about everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt H.-T.</span> For my part, I never half know what he means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> It is plain what he means. You must do exactly contrary
to what he tells you, as I shall. So, Auntie, don't trouble yourself
to alter my things unless it be to let them out, for I'm going
to keep all the breathing room I've got whether I have what's
called "a pretty waist" or not. I'd rather have color in my
cheeks and a cheerful heart than the smallest waist that was
ever squeezed together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt H.-T.</span> Such a pity, one couldn't have both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt F.</span> Your cousin Jane was in here last week with her
new Bismarck silk, and it fits her so beautifully! Somebody
said she looked as if she'd been melted and poured into it. There
wasn't a crease or wrinkle. It did look lovely!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> Well, Auntie dear, I must try some other way of looking
lovely. May be, if I'm cheerful and happy and always in good
spirits and have a fresh, bright face as Pussy always has, [<i>Puts
her arm affectionately about <span class="smcap">P.</span></i>] it may make up for my not
looking as if I had been melted and poured into my clothes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandma P.</span> [<i>Delightedly as she comes forward and joins
others who are now all standing</i>] This is just the way I thought
things would turn out if we followed Dr. Hardhack's Prescription.</p>

<p>This play was written to meet a request of church workers for a Christmas

parts for the play, as thus arranged, are those only that are found in
Act II, and are given below. All may be readily taken by children.</p>

naturally and spontaneously. Our play was such a success that at request

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
